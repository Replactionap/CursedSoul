Death is not the end, but merely a transition.
This mod introduces the concept of the Cursed Soul — an immortal entity that moves from body to body after each death.

Features:
    Immortal Soul: Upon death, you respawn in a new body.
    Progress Retention: All skills and accumulated experience transfer with the soul.
    Perfect for long-term survival: Ideal for extended campaigns.

Your soul is doomed to wander endlessly from one body to the next.
Whether it's a curse or a gift — that’s for you to decide.

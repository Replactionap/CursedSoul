This mod introduces the concept of the **Cursed Soul**: an immortal essence that drifts from body to body after each death.

## 🧬 Features

- 🔁 **Immortal Soul**  
  Upon death, your character is reborn in a new body — death no longer means the end.

- 🎓 **Progress Retention**  
  All skills, experience, and learned abilities are preserved and transferred to your new vessel.

- 📦 **(Planned) Weight Transfer**  
  In the future, your carried weight and inventory state will persist across transitions.

- 🧠 **(Planned) Independent of Starting Preset**  
  Your soul remembers who you were — regardless of your new body’s traits or backstory.
